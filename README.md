Overview of the Hospital Management System Project :-

project : The Hospital Management System project is a Java-based application integrated with a MySQL database. It aims to streamline key administrative and operational tasks within a hospital, such as patient management, appointment scheduling, electronic health records (EHR) management, and billing.
 
 *Technologies Used :-
Programming Language: Java (with JDBC for database connectivity)
Database: MySQL
User Input: Console-based interaction via the Scanner class
Database Operations: CRUD operations (INSERT, SELECT) using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
 
 *Key Features and Benefits :-
Patient-Centric Operations: Easy registration and centralized data storage for patients.
Appointment Management: Seamless scheduling with doctors.
Health Records: Convenient access to patient diagnoses, treatments, and prescriptions.
Billing Automation: Streamlined bill generation and tracking.
Scalability: Modular structure allows for easy addition of new features (e.g., inventory tracking, report generation).
Security: SQL injection prevention via prepared statements.

 *How It Works :-
The application is run, presenting users with a menu-driven interface.
Based on the user's choice, specific functions (e.g., patient registration, billing) are executed.
Data is fetched from or stored in the MySQL database using SQL queries via JDBC.
The system ensures data consistency through relational database design and validation.

This project provides a functional prototype of a hospital management system and can be extended for real-world deployment with enhancements like GUI development, role-based access, and integration with external services.
